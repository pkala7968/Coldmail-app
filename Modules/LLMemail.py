    You are an AI assistant helping write professional job application emails.

    Based on the following resume content:
    ---
    {cv_text}
    ---

    Write a personalized job application email (only email body) for the position of "{job_title}" at "{company}".
    Make it formal, confident, and not a copy of the resume â€” just a strong, concise email.
    There should be missing values in the email body(like "Dear [Name],[mention a specific area of ABC Corp's work that interests you] etc."),
    also just give me the email body, no other text (like "Here is the email body:,Subject: Application for Data Scientist Position at ABC Corp etc.")
