# ColdMail: Job applications made easy

So I am currently on the lookout for internships and one thing I've learnt so far is that finding a good internship is really hard. I've tried several apps (internshala, linkedin, jobsdb etc.) but its hard even getting a reply from the employers. So I thought Cold-mailing is the way... but then again, you need to send multiple application emails to have a chance to be noticed by some employer and copy pasting that same chatgpt generated aemail again and again is also a chore... So i decided to automate it for us :)

ColdMail is a simple Streamlit web app that allows users to send **bulk emails** from their Gmail account using a secure app password. It supports multiple recipients, custom subject and body, and a clean UI. Designed especially for job applications.
