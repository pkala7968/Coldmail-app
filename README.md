#  ColdMail: Job Applications Made Easy

So I am currently on the lookout for internships, and one thing I've learnt so far is that finding a good internship is really hard.  
I've tried several apps (Internshala, LinkedIn, JobsDB etc.) but it‚Äôs hard even getting a reply from employers.

So I thought **cold-mailing is the way**...  
But then again, you need to send multiple application emails to have a chance to be noticed, and copy-pasting the same ChatGPT-generated email again and again is also a chore...

### So I decided to automate it for us üòé

##  What is ColdMail?

ColdMail is a simple **Streamlit** web app that allows users to send emails to **multiple users** from their Gmail account using a secure **App Password**.

> Designed especially for job applications, it supports:
-  Multiple recipients
-  Automatically generate customized email bodies using your resume
-  Review each email before sending
-  Using a secure Gmail App Password
-  Review each email before sending
-  A clean and minimal UI

#### Note: 
    Your Gmail account is never stored anywhere.
    You authenticate securely using a Gmail App Password (with 2FA enabled), so your credentials stay safe.
