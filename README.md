# 📬 ColdMail: Job Applications Made Easy

So I am currently on the lookout for internships, and one thing I've learnt so far is that finding a good internship is really hard.  
I've tried several apps (Internshala, LinkedIn, JobsDB etc.) but it’s hard even getting a reply from employers.

So I thought **cold-mailing is the way**...  
But then again, you need to send multiple application emails to have a chance to be noticed, and copy-pasting the same ChatGPT-generated email again and again is also a chore...

### So I decided to automate it for us 😎
