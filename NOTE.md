# 🔐 Important Note for Gmail Users

To use this email sender app with your Gmail account, you’ll need to:

## ✅ 1. Enable 2-Step Verification  
This adds an extra layer of security to your Google account and is required by Google for generating app passwords.

👉 [Enable 2-Step Verification](https://myaccount.google.com/security)

---

## ✅ 2. Create an App Password  
Once 2FA is enabled, you can generate a special 16-digit **App Password** that works only with this app.  
This is **not your main Gmail password** — it’s a limited-use password that:

- Works only for sending emails
- Can be **revoked anytime**
- Doesn’t grant full account access

# 💡 Why This Is Safe

We **never store your credentials**. Your app password is:

- Used **only once** to send emails
- **Not logged or saved** anywhere
- Sent securely over an **encrypted (TLS)** connection to Gmail’s servers

App passwords are a secure feature provided by Google — designed specifically for connecting apps like this one.

## 🔒 Your Privacy and Security Matter

We follow security best practices:

- Your data is never stored
- Emails are only sent with your action
- You remain in full control

Not comfortable? You can **revoke the app password** anytime from your Google Account settings.
